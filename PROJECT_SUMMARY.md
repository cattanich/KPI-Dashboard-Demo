# Project Summary

## KPI Dashboard Application

This project is a web application for tracking and visualizing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). It allows users to browse, search, and analyze KPIs and related assets (dashboards, reports, documents, and visualizations).

## Technical Implementation

The application is built with:
- **Next.js**: For server-rendered React application
- **TypeScript**: For type safety
- **React**: For UI components
- **Zustand**: For state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Storybook**: For component documentation and testing

## Core Features

1. **Dashboard**: Main view with recent KPIs, assets, and quick stats
2. **KPI Library**: Browse and filter available KPIs
3. **Search**: Search across KPIs and assets
4. **Detail Views**: Detailed information about KPIs and assets
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

## Assumptions Made

Based on the flowchart and requirements provided, I made the following assumptions:

1. **Data Structure**: 
   - KPIs have properties like title, description, business questions, calculation formula, and available visualizations
   - Assets are categorized as dashboards, reports, documents, and visualizations
   - Users can favorite both KPIs and assets

2. **User Flow**:
   - Users primarily start from the dashboard or library
   - Detailed information is shown when a user selects a KPI or asset
   - Search is a primary method of finding specific KPIs

3. **Technical Architecture**:
   - State management is centralized (Zustand)
   - Component architecture follows a modular approach
   - Mock data is used in absence of a real API

4. **Visual Design**:
   - Clean, modern interface with cards for information display
   - Color coding for different types of assets
   - Responsive layout that works on all devices

## Future Enhancements

With more time, the following enhancements could be implemented:

1. **Interactive Visualizations**: Add charts and graphs for KPI data
2. **Real Backend Connection**: Replace mock data with API calls
3. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated filtering options
4. **User Accounts**: Authentication and personalization
5. **Export Functionality**: Allow exporting KPI data
6. **Collaborative Features**: Comments, sharing, and collaboration tools

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a modern approach to building a data-driven dashboard application. The architecture prioritizes maintainability, type safety, and user experience. The modular component design allows for easy extension and modification, while the centralized state management keeps data flow predictable and efficient.
